[] indicates status

Reading in and preprocessing data:
- Read processed bed file [100%]
- Read bam file with RG tags [100%]
- Read multiple bam files [100%]
- read unprocessed peak bed file and find non-overlapping, even-widthed peaks [0%]
- find peaks using databank of peaks? [0%]
- run preprocessing of bam files using shell scripts? [0%]
- get motif indices [100%]

- clustering of kmer variability across samples [30%]

Differential variablity
- find sets with greater variability in one sample versus another [0%]

Visualization

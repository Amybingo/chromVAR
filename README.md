chromatin Variability Across Regions (of the genome!)

[] indicates status

Reading in and preprocessing data:
- Read processed bed file [100%]
- Read bam file with RG tags [100%]
- Read multiple bam files [100%]
- read unprocessed peak bed file and find non-overlapping, even-widthed peaks [0%]
- find peaks using databank of peaks? [0%]
- run preprocessing of bam files using shell scripts? [0%]
- get motif indices [100%]
- get kmer indices [100%]
- get gapped kmer indices [80%]

Computing variability
- compute variability for set of peaks [100%]
- compute variability for set of sets of peaks [100%]
- plot variability [90%]
- find samples with high or low accessibility for set of peaks [50%]
- find peaks with high or low accessibility across set of samples [50%]
- find sets of peaks with independent variability [60%]
- find overlapping kmers with synergystic variability [75%]
- visualize kmers [10%]

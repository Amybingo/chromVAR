Made it mandatory to provide genome for some functions, rather than defaulting
to hg19.  Allow usage of FaFile or DNAStringSet instead of BSgenome for genome
input.

# chromVAR v0.4.2

ChromVAR is a package for determining variation in chromatin accessibility 
across sets of peaks sharing a common genomic annotations. Designed primarily 
for single-cell or sparse chromatin accessibility data, e.g. from scATAC-seq or
sparse bulk ATAC or DNAse-seq experiments.
